# Pandoras_Box_Of_Hack Ethical_Hacking

The project **_Pandoras_Box_Of_Hack_** is a Knowledge Base repository which consists, collections of tools, scripts, tutorials, resources, setups and work arounds to help in performing Vulnerabilty Analysis and Penetration Testing.

# Motivation

It been always my dream to create something which would help me and others who follow the same stream, to reduce the hustle of searching for the right tool and the proper procedure to go ahead with testing or analysis. We all do spent a lot of time online searching for tools or scripts which would make our job easy and sometime we may end up with nothing but fifteen to twenty tabs opened up in our browser. Other times we may not be able to find something which we had seen earlier and did'nt bothered to bookmark it for later or some url which is at the tip of your toung but sadly you are not able to getit out when you needed it badly. Thats when i thought of this repository where i can store all my aresenals for Vulnerability analysis and Penetration testing (VAPT). Hope this comes in handy for you too. Happy Hacking......!

# Story behind the name `Pandoras_Box_Of_Hack`

_Pandora_ was the first human woman in Greek mythology. She was created by the gods Hephaestus and Athena, following the instructions of Zeus, who wanted to punish Prometheus for stealing the fire from the gods to give it to humans. Zeus wanted her to neutralize the blessing of fire, which had been stolen. She was a masterwork for the ages this being, so beautiful and devious at the same time that wonder took hold of the deathless gods themselves! They called it **Pandora**, meaning the “All-Endowed,” because each of the gods who dwell on Olympus gave it some kind of a gift. Now, it seems that Pandora wasn’t enough of a punishment for mankind. So, the gods also bestow her with numerous other gifts, plagues and evils to men who eat bread which they packed neatly in a beautiful jar, her supposed dowry. With the jar in hand, Pandora was given in marriage to Epimetheus, Prometheus' brother, who accepted the divine gift despite his brother's warnings to never take a gift from Olympian Zeus.

One day, out of curiosity and not out of malice – Pandora lifted the lid of the jar, thus instantaneously releasing all evils and diseases of humanity including death into the world. Shocked by what had happened, she quickly tried to put the lid back, managing to merely trap Hope inside it. That is why Hope is the last thing that dies in man. Despite all our knowledge of the evil & unfortunate things that could & do befall us we can always still have hope! So keep your hopes high, you will find what you are searching for.
